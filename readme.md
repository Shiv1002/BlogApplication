```bash
touch .env
```

2. Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add the required environment variables. For example:

```env
# Example .env file
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
SESSION_SECRET=add-your-secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=cloud-key-name
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=cloud-key-secret
```

Make sure to replace the values with your actual configuration settings.
